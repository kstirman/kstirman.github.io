  <div> It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate how thrilling today&rsquo;s news about gravity waves is. The scientific community has been waiting a long time for this, and verification of the phenomenon has wide reaching implications in the fields of both astrophysics and particle physics. Gravity is, after all, the biggest thorn in the side of modern theoretical particle physics.
From a particle-centric standpoint gravity wave detection is identical to &lsquo;graviton&rsquo; detection. This is important because gravitons amount to the &lsquo;missing link&rsquo; between the currently disconnected realms of the very big (dictated by Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity) and the very small (governed by quantum mechanics). </div>

  <div> Lately I&rsquo;ve written a lot of custom functions to assist me in my example Drill analyses, but they&rsquo;ve all been of the same fundamental type: They take one or more columns of a single row and process them into a single output. The Drill documentation calls these &ldquo;simple&rdquo; functions. However there&rsquo;s another class of functions lurking out there&mdash;ones that can accept many rows of data as input. We call them &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; functions. </div>

  <div> One day you may find yourself with a custom function for Drill that&rsquo;s very particular about the kind of variables that it accepts. In particular, it may hold strong opinions about whether or not a variable is allowed to express a NULL value. In fact it may even be you who wrote this unavoidably fussy function (SPOILER: This is exactly what happened to me earlier this week).
Currently Drill lacks built-in functions to add or strip nullability from variables, but luckily it&rsquo;s very easy to whip up a couple UDFs which do exactly that. </div>

Implementations of this idea vary, but one of the simplest ones involves giving individual words a numeric score according to the strength of the positive or negative the emotions that they elicit. For instance we might assign a score of -2.3 to the word &lsquo;disappointment&rsquo; and a score of 1. </div>

For this article&rsquo;s test &lsquo;hardware&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll use six instances provisioned from Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 service, while the core software components will be provided by Cloudera&rsquo;s Hadoop system, CDH, paired with Ubuntu 14. </div>

  <div> For data wranglers wishing to store large amounts of text or numeric entries in an efficient fashion, the Apache Parquet file format makes for an obvious choice. As a storage medium, Parquet has two important benefits afforded by its columnar structure: 1.) Access to data columns can be made on an &lsquo;as needed&rsquo; basis, increasing the overall speed of queries, and 2.) Since all values in a column are serialized and compressed together, Parquet files take up much less room than similar plain text or row-wise compressed files. </div>

  <div> A new feature of Drill 1.3.0 is the ability to query CSV files using the column names listed in the file&rsquo;s header.
As an example, let&rsquo;s look at this CSV formatted file of countries that participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Before we begin, rename the file so that it ends in &lsquo;.csvh&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;.csv&rsquo;. The extension change tells Drill to parse the header of the CSV file, which means we can use the in-file identifiers for column names when we construct our queries. </div>

  <div> Amazon&rsquo;s Elastic MapReduce (EMR) service is a great way to create on-demand Hadoop clusters for ad hoc data analysis. The web based interface for the service is simple to use, and at its most basic level creating an EMR cluster is as easy as specifying the number and type of machines to use. But you can also instruct each computer to execute something called a &lsquo;bootstrap action&rsquo; just before coming online. </div>

  <div> Starting with version 1.3.0, Drill has the ability to query files stored on Amazon&rsquo;s S3 cloud storage using the S3a library. This is important, because S3a adds support for files bigger than 5 gigabytes (these were unsupported using Drill&rsquo;s previous S3n interface).
To enable Drill&rsquo;s S3a support, first edit the file conf/core-site.xml in your Drill install directory, replacing the text ENTER_YOUR_ACESSKEY and ENTER_YOUR_SECRETKEY with your AWS credentials.
&lt;configuration&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;fs.s3a.access.key&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;ENTER_YOUR_ACCESSKEY&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;fs. </div>

  <div> Last time I wrapped up by showing you how to look at Google Analytics JSON using a nested SQL query in Apache Drill. This approach is fine, but by implementing a custom function in Drill we can talk to the same data using a much simpler query.
To get started making user defined functions (UDFs), you first need to download and install Apache Maven. Once you have the tarball, move it to your home directory, and then do: </div>

  <div> Introduction In the realm of web analytics, Google&rsquo;s presence remains formidable. And it&rsquo;s no surprise&mdash;as a free service with a brain-dead easy setup and a wide range of collected user information, Google Analytics has a lot going for it. But if you&rsquo;d like to move away from the standard Analytics web interface, what are your options? The intended audience for this article is those who might wish for a little more flexibility with their Google Analytics data. </div>

  <div> If you find a large data store on the web that you&rsquo;re interested in, chances are good that it&rsquo;ll be available for download as a dump to a CSV file. The CSV format definitely isn&rsquo;t the most sophisticated data storage method around, but it&rsquo;s common, relatively intuitive for humans to read, and simple to import and export from spreadsheet software like Excel and LibreOffice. Many of us, however, might want to quickly integrate a CSV data set with an existing database system (like Hadoop or MongoDB) that&rsquo;s already in place. </div>

  <div> If you’re reading this post, then chances are you’ve found yourself wishing you could talk to your MongoDB data store using a standard SQL interface. There are lots of good reasons to do this: Maybe you’d like to port some existing code with a minimum of fuss, or maybe you’re dealing with a lot of different data storage types and would like to unify them all under a single interface (hint: Apache Drill is fantastic for this). </div>
